** Perl parser repositories
The branch =release= contains the files scanner.c and parser.c needed
to compile the dynamic libraries:
 - https://github.com/tree-sitter-perl/tree-sitter-perl
 - https://github.com/HaraldJoerg/tree-sitter-pod
   (forked from tree-sitter-perl because they don't have a =release=
   with parser.c yet)

** Emacs (Elisp) Manual     
 - The info node: [[info:elisp#Parsing Program Source][elisp#Parsing Program Source]],
 - in particular [[info:elisp#Tree-sitter Major Modes][Developing major modes with tree-sitter]]

* Developer hacks

If you change the default value in a =defvar= form, then re-evaluating
this form has no effect.  The following block clears some =defvar=
values and then re-evaluates =perl-ts-mode.el= so that the _current_
default values are applied again.

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp :results silent
  (makunbound 'perl-ts--font-lock-settings)
  (eval-buffer "perl-ts-mode.el")
#+END_SRC
